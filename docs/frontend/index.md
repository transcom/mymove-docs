## Note on Supported Browsers

As of 3/6/2018, the Defense Digital Service (DDS) has confirmed that support for IE is limited to IE 11 and Edge or newer versions. Currently, the intention is to encourage using Chrome and Firefox instead, with specific versions TBD. Research is incomplete on mobile browsers, but we are assuming support for iOS and Android. For more information please read [ADR0016 Browser Support](/docs/adrs/0016-Browser-Support.md).
