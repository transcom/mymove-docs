## What is Storybook

Storybook is a user interface development environment and playground for UI components. The tool enables developers to create components independently and showcase components interactively in an isolated development environment. [Read more here](https://storybook.js.org/docs/basics/introduction/)

## Basics

Storybook expects _stories_ to be defined for each component to be showcased. These stories are defined in the stories directory `src/stories`

### Option A: Running with tooling installed locally

This is the flow that most engineers will likely take since they probably have all the dependencies installed already.

#### Dependencies

If this is your first time running storybook you should run `make client_deps` first to ensure storybook packages are installed

#### How to run storybook server locally

To see the components locally simply run `make storybook` and the server will start and automatically open a browser window. If not open [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006)

#### How to generate static storybook site files

If you wish to generate the static version of storybook run `make build_storybook` and the command will generate the files in `storybook-static`

### Option B: Running in a docker container

If you don't have all the typical development tools installed this will walk you through running storybook without that. It does require docker to be installed you can get Docker CE for Mac from [here](https://download.docker.com/mac/stable/Docker.dmg). Detailed instructions for installation can be found in the [Docker for Mac Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)

Once Docker CE for Mac is installed run the `make storybook_docker` command to start the storybook server. This will not automatically start your browser so once you see the below you can open [http://localhost:6006/](http://localhost:6006/) and view storybook.

```console
>$ make storybook_docker
storybook_1  | webpack built e8e291d7822d6638fa63 in 18740ms
storybook_1  | ╭─────────────────────────────────────────────────╮

storybook_1  | │                                                 │
storybook_1  | ╰─────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

## Adding Stories

To showcase a component add the _stories_ to the `src/stories` folder in an appropriate file. The storybook documentation on [Writing Stories](https://storybook.js.org/docs/basics/writing-stories/) is a good place to start with how to create ones. If there is not an appropriate file you need to create a new file in the pattern `componentName.stories.js` in the src/stories directory, and then modify the `.storybook/config.js` file to include your new file in the generated site.

### Addons

Stories in Storybook can use addons to extend the features of Storybook. Some addons already included are the [actions](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/master/addons/actions) and [knobs](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/master/addons/knobs) addons. The controls for each of these addons shows up in a pane at the bottom of the page where they are used. If you cannot find the pane try toggling the _Change addons orientation_ from the ellipsis menu next to the logo in the upper left, or using the **D** keyboard short cut to toggle it.

#### Actions

Storybook Addon Actions can be used to display data received by event handlers in Storybook. See [the documentation](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/master/addons/actions) for more details.

#### Knobs

Storybook Addon Knobs allow you to edit props dynamically using the Storybook UI. You can also use Knobs as a dynamic variable inside stories in Storybook. See [the documentation](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/master/addons/knobs) for more details.

### Testing Stories

We use [Loki](https://loki.js.org/) for testing our storybook stories. You will need to approve any changes to the reference images before a build will pass. Read [How to Run Loki tests against Storybook](https://github.com/transcom/mymove/wiki/run-loki-tests-against-storybook) for details.

### Story changes require approval of Design

As part of the new process of Design and Engineering collaboration, the design team has been made code owners of the code in `src/stories` and the reference, i.e. approved, images in `.loki/reference`. So if you are adding a new story, modifying an existing one, or updating Loki reference images you will be required to have a designer give their approval on the GitHub PR.
