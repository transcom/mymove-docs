# GEX

GEX stands for Global Exchage. It is the DoD’s Global Exchange system for sending data securely with third parties that are outside of the DoD. For example, MilMove uses GEX to communicate with US Bank’s Syncada to send invoices and receive responses.

GEX only runs in the stg and prod environments.
