# Login.gov

You'll need accounts for login.gov and the login.gov sandbox. These will
require two-factor authentication, so have your second factor (one of: phone,
authentication app, security key, CAC) on hand. To create an account at
login.gov, use your regular `truss.works` email and follow [the official
instructions](https://login.gov/help/creating-an-account/how-to-create-an-account/).
To create an account in the sandbox, follow the same instructions, but [in the
sandbox server](https://idp.int.identitysandbox.gov/sign_up/enter_email). Do
_not_ use your regular email address in the sandbox.
