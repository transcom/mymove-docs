# Creating Alternative Users with the Same Email Address

You can use the plus sign `+` to create a new Truss email address.
`name+some_string@truss.works` will be treated as a new address, but will be
routed to your `name@truss.works` email automatically. Don't use this for the
office-side of account creation. It's helpful to use these types of accounts for
the customer-side accounts.
