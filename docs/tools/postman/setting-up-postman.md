# Setting up Postman

In addition to using the UI, you can use Postman to hit the [Admin](https://github.com/transcom/mymove/blob/master/swagger/admin.yaml), [Customer](https://github.com/transcom/mymove/blob/master/swagger/internal.yaml), and [Office](https://github.com/transcom/mymove/blob/master/swagger/ghc.yaml) APIs. They require a slightly different setup process from other uses of Postman on the Milmove project (see: [mTLS setup](https://github.com/transcom/mymove/wiki/setup-postman-to-make-mutual-tls-api-calls)). 

In order to set up Postman, you need to have Postman, local server, and local client running.

`make server_run`

`make office_client_run`

### IMPORTANT: devlocal vs STG / EXP
The example on this page is written for **devlocal**. **If you want to hit STG or EXP, you must use https:// in your base path**. If you don't, you will get strange behavior, zero helpful error messages, and a headache. 

**Remember:**
* Use `https://` in your `{{baseUrl}}` on STG/EXP
* Use `http://` in your `{{baseUrl}}` on LOCAL

## Office vs Admin vs Customer APIs

The steps in this doc apply to any API. The only differences are:

- Base path
	- `http://milmovelocal:3000/internal/` - Customer Local
	- `https://my.stg.move.mil/internal/` - Customer STG (note the HTTPS)
	- `http://officelocal:3000/ghc/v1/` - Office Local
	- `https://office.stg.move.mil/ghc/v1/` - Office STG (note the HTTPS)
	- `http://adminlocal:3000/admin/v1/` - Admin Local
	- `https://admin.stg.move.mil/admin/v1/` - Admin STG (note the HTTPS)
- Cookies/Session Token
	- For the Internal/Customer endpoints, make sure to log in to the Customer app and use the `mil_session_token`.
        - For the GHC/Office endpoints, make sure to log in to the Office app and use the `office_session_token`.
	- For the Admin endpoints, make sure to log in to the Admin app and use the `admin_session_token`.
- Collection Files
    - `internal.yaml` - customer
    - `ghc.yaml` - office
    - `prime.yaml` - prime
    - `admin.yaml` - admin
    - `support.yaml` - non-production API that is designed to help the Prime with testing

## Importing a Collection
The steps below are walking through adding the GHC collection, but can be applied to any collection that you wish to add.

### Adding the GHC collection

- Click on the "Collections" tab in the left sidebar.

- Click the "Import" button next to "My Workspaces" and then click the "Upload Files" button on the modal.

- Navigate to the MilMove project folder on your machine, then locate the "Swagger" folder.

- Select the `ghc.yaml` file and click "Open".

- Confirm your selection on the modal (default values are fine) and click "Import".

  You should now see the "GHC API" listed in your collections.

## Retrieving the Cookies
Now here comes the fun part, choose your own adventure!
For these APIs, we need to supply Postman with the appropriate session cookies from a logged-in user.
You can either create your own environment to hold the cookies, or use a cookie interceptor.

### [Creating an Environment](https://github.com/transcom/mymove/wiki/Creating-A-Local-Environment-for-Postman)
You'll want to make your own environment if: 
* You're having trouble using the cookie interceptor
* You want a relatively quick setup
* You want to configure additional variables to use in your API calls

### [Using a Cookie Interceptor](https://github.com/transcom/mymove/wiki/Intercepting-Cookies-for-Postman)
You'll want to use the cookie interceptor if: 
* You're having trouble creating the environment
* You don't want to have to create a new environment file for each API and have to swap between them
* You want cookies to be grabbed automatically for you

## Specialized Postman Setup
If you are planning to use Postman for testing the prime and support APIs, you will need to make the following changes to support Mutual TLS.
