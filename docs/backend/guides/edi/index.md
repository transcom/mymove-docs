# EDI 858

:::note

Since EDI is not proprietary to the MilMove project, most documentation comes in the form of external links.

Always ensure you are using the most up-to-date specs. Note also that since the documentation is primarily stored in Google Drive, reorganization of the materials there may not be reflected here.

[EDI (Electronic Data Interchange)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_data_interchange) is a non-proprietary format for standard formatting of electronic messages between business partners.

The MilMove project uses EDI to send payment requests related to moves to US Bank.
