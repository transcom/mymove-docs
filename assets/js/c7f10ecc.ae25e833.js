This meant that all tests would likely need to have this flag set in some obfuscated initialization code while still making the flag overridable. This added additional complexity and made it so that we could theoretically add a conditional for the flag throughout our codebase. This opens the possibility for code to branch out in a myriad of ways even when we only wanted this functionality to be used in a specific way.
